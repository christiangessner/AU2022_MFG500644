# MFG500644 | Hybrid PDM, PLM and ERP: Sync Data Between Cloud and On-Premises Systems

## KEY LEARNING
- Learn about the difficulties of synchronizing data between cloud systems and on-premises software.
- Explore different ways to synchronize and transform data in hybrid environments (cloud PLM and on-prem PDM/ERP).
- Learn about efficiently transferring data from cloud systems to Vault Professional or to on-prem ERP systems.
- Learn how to use Autodesk Forge Webhooks and Autodesk Fusion 360 Manage Scripting to notify on-premises software about changes.

## DESCRIPTION
Product lifecycle management (PLM) systems such as Autodesk Fusion 360 Manage software or Upchain run in the cloud while Vault software and most enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are still installed on-premises. Hidden behind firewalls, on-premises software cannot directly receive update notifications from cloud applications, and have difficulty synchronizing with changes from cloud systems. Polling data from large data sets is time consuming and inefficient. Automated synchronization and digital transformation of data between hybrid PDM, PLM, and ERP systems require more-sophisticated solutions. This class will demonstrate how to efficiently send data from cloud to on-premise systems. Weâ€™ll use different examples to demonstrate how the Autodesk Forge Webhooks API and Autodesk Fusion 360 Manage Action Scripts are used to automatically update entities in Vault software, or how cloud PLM systems automatically send Bill of Materials (BOM) data to on-premise ERP systems without the need for the on-premise software to poll for data.
